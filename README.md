# Gradle project template

This template is intended as a project starter, using the Gradle project structure and build system, but providing a slightly more complete starting point than that generated by the New Project wizard dialog in IntelliJ IDEA.

For help in getting started with additional project configuration, see [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md).

We recommend that the developer(s) replace the heading and body of this file with the name and summary of their project.
